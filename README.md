# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Name of Company

* Venmo

## When was company incorporated?

* 2009

## Who are the founders of the company?

* Andrew Kortina & Iqram Magdon-Ismail

## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

* The co-founders ‘met as randomly paired freshman year roommates at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001.’ (Kortina 2014).  

* Both began as computer science majors, but Kortina moved on, into English and Philosophy, explaining his lack of interest in paying for the tuition, doing menial computer programming tasks.  

* ‘I couldn’t justify tuition costs when I was only learning by spending time doing programming exercises, and I developed a hypothesis that I would maximize the value of tuition costs by studying the least practical subjects possible, the things I would not get to do after graduation / outside of University, like reading and discussing great books with a group of incredibly smart students and professors (this backfired, btw–liberal arts is very practical stuff!). I eschewed big lectures and things like On Campus Recruiting, and tried to spend as much time possible in seminars and writing workshops. I ended up with majors in Philosophy and Creative Writing and minors in Computer Science and Logic.’ (Kortina 2014)

* As seniors, the two co-founders worked on a few small startup projects, like ‘My College Post’, a social networking app for classifieds, ‘Swooge’, a web analytics tool, and a music site called ‘Philafunk’.  

* During this time living together, in West Philly, Kortina and Magdon-Ismael were working in freelance design, in addition to helping with these new startups.

* For several years following their time together in West Philadelphia, Kortina and Magdon-Ismael knew they would someday work together again, regardless of their time apart working for various businesses on their own.

* Kortina had been working with the now famous, bit.ly, and Magdon-Ismael at Ticketleap, when they decided to make their move.

* In 2009, they decided to throw themselves into a project they called Venmo.  

* Venmo, from the word ‘vendere’, Latin for ‘to sell’, adding ‘mo’ for mobile, making the word we know today.  

* Why Venmo?  GoDaddy would have the URL available for cheap, the word was short, and could be used in various tenses, like verbs and nouns.  

* Venmo was originally created as ‘a music startup that allowed people to send a text to a band to have an mp3 show up in their email’ (D’Onfro 2014).  

## When did the company pivot into the peer to peer transfer software we know today?

* On a trip to New York City, visiting his partner, Magdon-Ismael realized he had forgotten his wallet at home, and upon asking Kortina to borrow some money, the two realized exactly how cumbersome it was for Magdon-Ismael to get out a check and writing it out to Kortina, paying him back.  

* Originally money would be sent through text messages, but once the two cofounders realized the detailed story aspect of each transaction occurring on their platform, they decided to introduce the social platform portion of the app.  

## How is the company funded?  How much funding did they receive?

* It wasn’t easy… at all:

* ‘At one meeting, an investor said that he was only interested in "billion-dollar, home run opportunities." Magdon-Ismail was fast on his feet: "This will be a trillion-dollar company." (D’Onfro 2014)

* The first investor was an angel investment by Magdon-Ismael’s previous boss at Ticketleap, and his father.  

* Venture capital funding began in 2010, with RRE ventures, betaworks, Lerer Ventures, Founder Collective…10 investors total, for $1.3 million in funding over 3 rounds.  Their latest funding was raised on August 1, 2011 from a Series A round.  Lerer Hippeau and RRE Ventures are the most recent investors. Venmo has invested in Enboarder on Nov 20, 2018. This investment - Venture Round - Enboarder - was valued at $4M.  (Crunchbase)

## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Simply put they are helping peer to peer money transfers easier, and even immediate.  

## Who is the company’s intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  

* The company’s intended customer is anyone looking to transfer money from bank to bank or account to account, without needing checks, through mobile technology.  

* ‘In the past two years, Venmo has seen significant growth from 10 million to 40 users…  Zelle has gained a strong foothold in the US, but Venmo still holds a commanding lead in the under 35 age bracket.  Only 20 percent of Americans use mobile apps to pay for things, a lot less than China, India, and Europe.’  (Curry 2020)
 
## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?  (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Venmo, unlike PayPal or Zelle, is a mobile-first service, created for smaller ranged transfers, and contains a social media aspect its competitors do not, making the demographic of interest much wider, including the younger generations. 

* Venmo, unlike PayPal, uses bank-grade security and encryption, as well as a mobile PIN code the app uses when logging in, opening, and transferring (as does PayPal).  

* Venmo creates a family or group feel to the platform, by requiring you to register an account, as well as require contacts or ‘friends’, in order to transfer money.  

* Unlike Venmo, PayPal ‘uses data servers to continuously scan browsers to make sure they are using updated data encryption technology for better safety. Additionally, the service will also send users a confirmation email whenever their transaction is completed or sent to alert users that their funds reached the recipient. 

* Compared to PayPal, Venmo ‘has much less business-oriented features and is designed more for P2P transactions as it doesn't provide any special loans or fees for merchants.’  (Sraders 2020)

* Venmo has a much smaller transfer limit, along with no business features like PayPal Business offers.  Allowing up to 3000.00 transferrable dollars per day, vs. PayPal’s 10000.00 daily limit.  
Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?  

* Peer to Peer ACH Transfers:

* ‘Initially conceived as a p2p (peer-to-peer) payment app, Venmo combines the concept of a payment wallet app with that of a social network. Presently, the app allows making secure, cashless transactions with both friends and businesses located in the user’s vicinity. The user’s account is linked to either their bank account or their credit card. It is possible to make a search for and add a friend, as well as view all your transactions, illustrated with emoticons, in a continuous feed.’ (Vilmate 2019)

* According to Vilmate, the ‘optimal approach would be to implement a capability that would adjust all impacted amounts across your system at set intervals. Then, peer-to-peer data synchronization in payment apps is taken under control’ (Vilmate 2019), when creating a Peer to Peer payment platform on your own, similar to Venmo. 

* Your mobile payment app has to interact with eCommerce sites, just like Venmo does, if you are going to become a major player in the Peer to Peer space.  

* And with all apps, the UX and UI development of your app will be vital when finding and retaining customers.  

* The public Venmo API was queried by ScienceDirect.com during the summer of 2018, using a ‘custom developed python script deployed on an Amazon Web Services virtual EC2 service instance.

* These queries collectively returned 328,769,355 public transactions beginning in March 20, 2012 until April 25, 2018.’  (Acker & Murthy 2020)

## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* P2P Payments

## What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* The peer-to-peer sector has exploded in recent years with financial institutions jumping on the FinTech bandwagon, offering new technologies and services.  

* Another trend in ACH volumes has been the growth in same day payments with growth of 137% in volume and 83% value in 2018 vs 2017.   

* The launch of a debit card by Venmo, in 2018, has been a massive development for the company, helping ward off competitors joining in to not only the P2P space, but also the debit card space.  
What are the other major companies in this domain?

* Paypal, Zelle, Cash App, Square, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, among many many others.  

## What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* The biggest impact Venmo has had so far is expanding the range of P2P transfers from a narrow demographic, to include other demograpnics, such as Millenials, demonstrating how easy transferring can be.  

## What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?  How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* The metric used by people in the P2P sector is Total Payments Volume.  

* How has Venmo’s TPV looked? 

* (https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.insider.com%2F5d3b1813100a2447f5509c8b%3Fwidth%3D1136%26format%3Djpeg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fvenmo-played-key-role-growing-paypals-tpv-2019-7&tbnid=vROrFbVzu48Z-M&vet=12ahUKEwix776XhtntAhUG9qwKHXXuAwsQMygCegUIARCiAQ..i&docid=lw-Wp_Ohigd5DM&w=1136&h=852&q=Venmo%20Total%20Payments%20Volume&ved=2ahUKEwix776XhtntAhUG9qwKHXXuAwsQMygCegUIARCiAQ) 

* The other metric used is pretty obvious: revenue.  

* Along with the ever-expanding customer base Venmo continues to show, fees generated from instant transfers, the new Venmo card, and payments using the app help boost their revenue every quarter.  

## How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

* In every demographic, but Millennial, Zelle outperforms Venmo.  

* However, in the latter, Venmo continues to reign supreme.  

## If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?  

* I believe I would push harder on the payments portion of Venmo (Pay by Venmo), as e-Commerce stores will produce more revenue for not only the company, but Venmo as well, through fees accrued by these stores.  

## Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* Simple, you want to make money in P2P transfers, then reach out to more potential partners / clients in the eCommerce and Brick & Mortar space.  

## What technologies would this additional product or service utilize and why are they appropriate for your solution?

* I believe social interaction between an agent at Venmo and a partner or client for Pay by Venmo, is the major technology or additional work needed to create more revenue for the company.  

* You could even send out AI-driven cold calls or cold e-mails to potential clients not only at ecommerce and B&M’s, but also personal users, potentially lead generating every single second.
